# think of .SD as a symbol representing â€œeach group"
# .BY is a special symbol that holds the value of by
# .N is an integer containing the number of rows in the group.
# .I is an integer vector equal to seq_len(nrow(x))
# .GRP is an integer containing a simple group counter
# .NGRP is an integer containing the number of groups
